## üëãüèª Hi, I'm Bruno Alves

 I am a frontend instructor passionate about technology and software development. I believe that Patrick Rothfuss' quote, "No matter how you live your life, your intelligence will defend you better than a sword. Keep it sharp!" perfectly reflects my approach to life and career. 

After working for years in logistics, I made a radical change and pursued my dream of working with technology. It was a big challenge, but I am happy I made this decision and became a frontend instructor at Trybe. 

As an instructor, I have had the opportunity to witness the evolution of several people in software development and feel honored to be a part of this process. To me, software development is an art form that mixes creativity and logic in a beautiful way. My knowledge in Javascript, React, Node.js, Python, MySql, and Mongodb allows me to help students master these technologies and become successful software developers. 

I am always looking to stay updated with the latest trends in technology and software development, and I love learning new skills and tools. My goal is to one day become a technical reference, sharing my knowledge and experience with other professionals. I seek to stay updated with the latest technologies and trends in the market, improving my skills, and sharing my knowledge.
